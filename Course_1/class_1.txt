Basics (Before starting with robotics)

- The basics
	* We will be looking into several things
	* This will help with the courses that will come after this

- Probability Primer and Recursive Bayes Filter
	* Autonomous mobile systems
		> Those systems need to work with probabilities
		> Best done with probabilistic approaches
		> Recurring terms in this course
		> Estimating localisation
		> Will be touching on SLAM
	* High level motions that are executed
	* Robotic State Estimation
		> Where am I?
		> What does the world look like?
